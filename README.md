# Exploring Insights From Synthetic Airline Data Analysis With Qlik
## Project Overview
The "Exploring Insights from Synthetic Airline Data Analysis with Qlik" project aims to extract valuable insights from synthetic airline data by leveraging Qlik's robust analytical capabilities. The dataset includes a variety of variables such as flight statuses (e.g., on-time, delayed, cancelled), passenger demographics (e.g., age, gender), and geographic distribution (e.g., routes, destinations). This project demonstrates how Qlik can be used to uncover hidden patterns, identify emerging trends, and discover correlations that could influence key decisions in the airline industry.
